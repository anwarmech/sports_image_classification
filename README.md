This project uses a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning to classify images into 100 different sports categories. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset of sports images and achieves high accuracy. It leverages pre-trained ResNet50 from ImageNet and includes custom layers for the classification task.
